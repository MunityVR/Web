        <hr class="divider">
        <div class="about"><center><p>I am self taught at age 14, I was curious how minecraft servers run their little games and then I learned they use plugins. I started a little private server to mess around with plugins, I started to want to create my own plugin and I started to go through tutorials. I learn that plugins are programmed in Java (Which is a programming language)</p></center>
        <center><p>I started to learn the basics first and then start to work my way to the plugin. I didn't stop there because I wanna make something amazing which is a minecraft mod for the 1.11.2 version of minecraft (1.11.2 was the latest version at the time). When I was about done with it, I decided to move on to AI's, so I learned python and tried to make an AI from scratch (big learning curve to learn to program an AI).</p></center>
        <center><p>I decided to program a 2D game that has levels (biggest mistake by the way). I use Java for this project because I am more familiar with Java than Python. I started to work on the window for the game and then all of the game assets and holy crap baskets, I needed to make a game engine (I swear the headache it gave me). I could have used an already made one like Unity or Unreal Engine but I wanted to create it from scratch because I wanted to see if I could do it (it killed my brain and afterwards I wasn't okay because I stayed up basically 24/7, DO NOT DO THIS! Because mental health is important) The engine itself took me 1 whole year but everything else wasn't so painful, but I was about to finish it and then my PC broke down AND MY SSD IS JUST SITTING THERE WITH NOTHING ELSE TO DO BESIDES SITTING THERE LOOKING PRETTY!</p></center>
        <center><p>Okay let's continue before I go insane, so I decided to take some break until (holy muffins) I saw a social platform called VRChat that allows you to make your own content. This is my first time going into the VR genre and my first experience with VR, this would be my first time using Unity and to be able to make wholesome friends that are interested in programming like I was (Lets say, nobody is wholesome in VRChat, Idk why I had so high expectations, I need to lower my expectations on things) but more I play VRChat nobody wasn't that interested even though there are those that do make content, it wasn't excitement. I not gonna lie that it hurts and everything about this social platform have changed me | My Phychology: (I am no longer wholesome), I got into relationships which I promise myself to not get into because how toxic it can be even poly relationships can be toxic but I changed so much that I didn't look at my pychology anymore nor morality (lemme tell you how big this change was, I am between straight and asexual also was completely wholesome and have a very high expectations for other and try to encourage others. Now, I am bi-sexual and no longer wholesome, my expectations of other is very low and I do not encourage others as much but I do offer help if needed but just wasn't the same) End of Pychology</p></center>
        <center><p>I went back into projects for VRChat and I decided to program a minecraft mod again but more bigger of a mod then I made last time but this time, I am working alone and these projects is being worked on for one person (by the way, I gotten hypnotized at the point because my curiosity of what is it and what does someone feel when hypnotized, the person that hypnotized me is the person I been looking for to talk to when I first went on VRChat but one down side, they're not wholesome), this person is special in my eyes at least (how I am now, they are considered as special but if we talk about first time I went on VRChat then sadly no) and they are an interesting specimen (so is the person that hypnotize me).</p></center>
        <center><p>Thank you for reading about me and my thoughts about me. I know I don't have to write any of this down about VRChat and my thoughts of the community and others but it's a way for me to put it out there and remove the weight off my shoulders. Do not get me wrong, the community is great it just depends on the people you surround yourself with.</p></center></div>
